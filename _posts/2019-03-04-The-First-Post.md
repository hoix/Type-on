So, I've decided to start a blog - and here I'm going to tell you where it'll take me.
<!--more-->

This is my first time doing something like this - aside from making a few unimaginative posts on Reddit. But I want this to be something different. I've a few ideas for what I'm going to cover on this blog, and what my targets/aims are. I don't want to cover myself again, as everything you'd want to know about me is in the about section.

### Write about interesting stuff.

Effectively, my aim is to be the much lower quality version of [Half As Interesting](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuCkxoKLYO_EQ2GeFtbM_bw). I'll cover topics I find interesting in depth - such as the mess that is London's Airport System to how Feng Shui dominates the skyline in Hong Kong. I've got tons of ideas and I can't wait to bring them to fruition.

### Weekly/Monthly recaps and residential blogs

In the past two weeks before writing this blog I've been accepted into two resedential schools - UNIQ (An Oxford Summer School - albeit I am going in April), and the US Sutton Trust programme. The latter gives me and the cohort the chance to go to the United States for an entire week, exploring what it is like to study in the United States. It also requires I take the ACT, a test which is the complete antithesis of a British exam. Both are incredible opportunities and I can't wait to write about how they were.

### Revision Guides (for A-level and GCSE)

Having already gone through my GCSEs, I'm in a good position to help the current students who will have their exams in May. I plan on releasing some notes, guides and exam-related advice for them. 

In relation to A-levels, I feel that making my own public notes and help guides for topics that I struggle with would be a great revision resource for not only myself but all other A-level students. 

### Coding Projects

Although I don't do Computer Science A-level, I do love coding. This website is hosted on Github, using Github Pages and based of Jekyll - a Python Framework for building blogs like mine. I often attempt some bizarre and interesting projects so I'll be able to blog the results on here.

### Conclusion

I hope I've shown you what I want to do with this blog, and if you've got any questions, feel free to drop me an email (I'll be adding a comment section in a few days).
