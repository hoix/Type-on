I'm a year 12 student at Blue Coat CofE School in Coventry - and I'm studying Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Economics and Physics. I want to go to university, but I've no idea what I want to do.

This blog is ultimately a place for me to write about stuff I find interesting. I don't plan on any fixed content structure, but expect articles on everything from planes to postal services, mathematics to macroeconomics - literally anything.

I am an avid programmer, and puzzle solver - I have entered the [National Cipher Challenge](https://www.cipherchallenge.org/) twice, I often play chess (badly), and own a few puzzle books. I also, like most people, love sleeping.
