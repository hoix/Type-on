This is a photo gallery made from the files in the `assets/img/unsplash` folder. [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) is a website with some amazing photos for commercial or non-commercial use, and I've been using it for a long time - and it's where all the photos on this website are from. It's incredibly useful - and I find it much better than the available alternatives.
